# Deep Learning-Based Image Classification for Integrating Pathology and Radiology in AI-Assisted Medical Imaging

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **Domain-Informed Adaptive Network (DIANet)** and **Adaptive Clinical Workflow Integration (ACWI)** for integrating pathology and radiology in AI-assisted medical imaging. Our approach aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve clinical workflows by addressing key challenges in multi-modal imaging, dataset imbalance, and interpretability.

## Features

- **Multi-Scale Feature Extraction:** Captures detailed patterns across various imaging modalities.
- **Domain-Specific Priors:** Incorporates expert knowledge to improve AI decision-making.
- **Bayesian Uncertainty Modeling:** Enhances interpretability and reliability in clinical settings.
- **Adaptive Learning Mechanisms:** Mitigates domain shifts and handles imbalanced datasets.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Ensures transparency and trustworthiness in clinical applications.
- **Modular Clinical Workflow Integration:** Compatible with PACS and other healthcare systems.

## Methodology

### Domain-Informed Adaptive Network (DIANet)
DIANet integrates multi-modal medical imaging with advanced deep learning techniques:
- Uses **multi-scale feature extraction** for detailed analysis.
- Incorporates **domain-specific priors** to guide learning.
- Employs **Bayesian uncertainty modeling** for robust decision-making.

### Adaptive Clinical Workflow Integration (ACWI)
ACWI ensures the seamless deployment of AI models in real-world medical settings:
- Utilizes **explainable AI (XAI)** for clinician-friendly insights.
- Implements **uncertainty-aware decision support** to improve reliability.
- Enables **modular workflow integration** with existing medical imaging systems.

## Results

Our experimental evaluation demonstrates:
- **Enhanced diagnostic accuracy** across pathology and radiology datasets.
- **Improved segmentation precision** and **reconstruction fidelity**.
- **Robust performance across diverse imaging modalities**, reducing domain shifts.
